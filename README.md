🍽️ Mobile Functional Testing Project - URBAN LUNCH

📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on functional testing of a mobile food ordering application, with special attention to user experience, design consistency, and behavior validation under both normal and unexpected conditions.
The testing process was conducted manually using an Android emulator, and the visual components were verified against Figma prototypes to ensure alignment between development and design.

Test scenarios included:

Positive and negative user interactions

UI layout verification

Navigation between screens

Error handling and boundary cases

💻 Technologies Used

Android Studio – Mobile application testing environment

Android Emulator – To simulate real device conditions

Figma – Design prototype reference

JIRA – (If applicable) For tracking bugs or test documentation

👩‍💼 Key Responsibilities

Created detailed checklists with positive and negative test cases based on app requirements

Executed manual tests on the Android emulator, simulating real-user interactions

Compared UI components, layout, and flow against Figma design prototypes to ensure visual consistency

Identified usability and layout inconsistencies and documented findings

Validated key functionalities such as menu selection, cart behavior, and order flow

Reported any issues discovered and retested after resolution

🚀 Impact & Achievements

Ensured a consistent and error-free user experience across core functionalities of the mobile app

Improved communication between QA and design teams by identifying visual deviations

Contributed to a more polished and intuitive product before release by validating both functionality and design fidelity

Reduced visual discrepancies by early identification and reporting of layout misalignments
